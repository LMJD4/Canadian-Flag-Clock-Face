# Canadian-Flag-Clock-Face
This app is a Fitbit clock face with a customizable Canadian flag as the background. This app requests access to your heart-rate monitor, as well as your activity. Both the colour of the maple leaf on the flag, and the colour of all text on the flag is customizable through the settings section on the Fitbit app. If you have any questions, contact me through issues or on my email at luke.dsouza4@gmail.com
